###4x4 Othello

CS 331 project where I built the alphabeta pruning function for the Alphabeta AI player, which was used to compare the number of nodes searched using a minimax function versus a more efficient alphabeta pruning method. Analysis of the performance, along with different heuristics the AI could use to determine what an optimal decision was, is included in the othello report.
