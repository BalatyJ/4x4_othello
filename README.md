### 4x4 Othello

* A simplified game of Othello where a minimax function with optional alpha beta pruning was implemented to compare the performance with alpha beta pruning on and off for an adversarial search algorithm.

* Built using Python for the game board and computer AI.

* Utilized MatPlotLib to graph each player AIâ€™s stats to report on time taken and performance obtained using different heuristics and with alpha beta pruning on and off.

* Analysis of the performance, along with different heuristics the AI could use to determine what an optimal decision was, is included in the othello report.
